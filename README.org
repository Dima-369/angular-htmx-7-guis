* Angular and HTMX solutions to 7 GUIs

Note that the Angular code assumes that the Java Sprint Boot server runs at http://localhost:8083

In development, I develop the Angular version first to have the UI going and then I jump into =Intellij= and code the entire backend solution there. It is initiated like this, for example, from =src/app/flight-booker-htmx/flight-booker-htmx.component.html=:

#+begin_src html
<form class="flex items-center" id="div-flight-booker"
      hx-get="http://localhost:8083/flight-booker-update"
      hx-trigger="load">
</form>
#+end_src

* TODO

- deploy Angular on Github Pages?
- show demo screenshots or videos?
- finish all tasks (3/7 done)
- add tests for the non HTMX Components
- brush over DRY principal everywhere
